### 👋 Hi, I’m @badBrock

- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Statistical Analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various machine learning algorithms and tools, including regression models, clustering, and ensemble techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects or any interesting data science challenges!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at clashbrockmini@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not diving into datasets, you can find me exploring anime worlds, getting lost in books, or strategizing in Clash of Clans.
